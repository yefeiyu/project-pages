This is a page whose content is getting transformed into a tag page.

I am very curious how this is going to turn out.

| *Return Code* | *Result*                       |
|---------------+--------------------------------|
|             0 | I am happy!                    |
|             1 | Geez, what happened this time? |
|            -1 | Even more worrying             |

Below this, I expect some links to other pages related to the tag
"exampletag":
